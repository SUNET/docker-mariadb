# About this Repo

This is the Git repo of the Docker image for MariaDB. It's based on the official MariaDB image with a few notable differences: the base image is the latest stable Debian image and all the components are installed from the official Debian repos. See [the Docker Hub page for the official MariaDB image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image.
